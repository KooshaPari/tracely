Feature: phenotype-sentinel Domain Behavior
  As a developer
  I want to ensure phenotype-sentinel behaves correctly
  So that the system remains reliable and maintainable

  Background:
    Given the phenotype-sentinel system is initialized

  @FR-001 @smoke @critical
  Scenario: Entity creation succeeds with valid data
    Given a valid entity configuration
    When I create a new entity
    Then the entity should be persisted
    And the entity ID should be returned

  @FR-002 @validation @negative
  Scenario: Entity creation fails with invalid data
    Given an invalid entity configuration
    When I attempt to create a new entity
    Then the operation should fail
    And an appropriate error should be returned

  @FR-003 @integration
  Scenario: Entity workflow transitions correctly
    Given an existing entity in state "pending"
    When I execute the "approve" transition
    Then the entity should be in state "approved"
    And the transition event should be recorded

  @FR-004 @security @critical
  Scenario: Unauthorized access is rejected
    Given an unauthenticated user
    When I attempt to access protected resources
    Then the request should be denied
    And an authentication error should be logged

  @FR-005 @performance
  Scenario Outline: System handles load efficiently
    Given <concurrent> concurrent operations
    When I execute them within <time_limit> seconds
    Then all operations should complete successfully
    And the average response time should be under <threshold>ms

    Examples:
      | concurrent | time_limit | threshold |
      | 10         | 5          | 100       |
      | 100        | 10         | 200       |
      | 1000       | 30         | 500       |
